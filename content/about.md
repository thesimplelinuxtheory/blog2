Hello everyone! I’m a tech enthusiast and I’ve been on a journey of learning new technologies and tools in the world of open source software. I’ve been particularly interested in Linux, Docker, Podman, Hugo and more.

I started my journey with Linux as the operating system on my personal computer and I’ve been amazed by its stability, security, and customization capabilities. I then learned about Docker and how it makes it easier to create, deploy, and run applications inside containers.

Recently, I discovered Podman, which is a powerful alternative to Docker and has some advantages, such as being more secure and easier to use without a daemon.

In addition, I’ve also been learning about Hugo, a static site generator, and using it to create fast, secure and flexible websites.

I started my journey of learning all this during the pandemic and it’s been amazing. I can’t wait to continue learning and exploring more. I’m excited to continue sharing my experiences along the way. I hope this journey will also inspire others to dive into the world of open source technology and explore the possibilities.
