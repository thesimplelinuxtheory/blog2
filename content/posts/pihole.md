# Pi-hole: A Comprehensive Guide to Blocking Ads on Your Network

Are you tired of being bombarded with irrelevant ads while browsing the web? Want to take control of your internet experience and block unwanted ads? Then Pi-hole is the answer you’re looking for.

### What is Pi-hole?

Pi-hole is a free and open-source software that acts as a DNS server to block ads, trackers, and malicious websites. It’s designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, but can also be installed on other Linux-based systems. With Pi-hole, you can enjoy an ad-free internet experience on all your devices connected to the same network.

### How does Pi-hole work?

The Pi-hole works by intercepting and blocking the DNS queries made by your devices. When you enter a website’s URL into your browser, your device sends a DNS query to your router, which then forwards it to your internet service provider’s DNS server. The Pi-hole acts as a local DNS server that sits between your router and your devices, intercepting the DNS queries before they reach the internet. It then blocks the requests for ads and trackers, ensuring that your devices never receive the ads or other unwanted content.
