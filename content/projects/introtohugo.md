# Static Websites

Hugo Static Websites are extraordinary! As youâ€™re probably aware, I am a technophile with limited knowledge of technology and software. I intend to create a setting in which beginners learning Linux and other topics do not feel lost.

Linux was initially introduced to me after viewing a YouTube video by ChrisTitus and DT-DistroTube. Despite my failure to absorb anything while repeatedly viewing a video, these two men gave me the confidence to start experimenting with Linux. It was annoying to interrupt the video in order to research unexpected subjects. I asked help from a local computer store in order to install Linux on my computer, as I was incapable of doing so on my own.

After all those days of bewilderment and sleepless hours spent searching for answers, I can now claim I have a better understanding of certain topics, but I still have a lot to learn, which is fascinating!

It will take time and effort to make the entire process more digestible for those who are new to Linux, but i hope that doing so will assist many people in understanding the fantastic things that can be accomplished with a better grasp of technology.

The first project I will publish will describe how to make a Hugo website utilizing github pages and will be released online. The procedure is tiresome for individuals unfamiliar with this setting, as well as myself. I viewed a number of YouTube lessons on Hugo, but only after many hours did I find one that I was able to successfully implement in order to create a functional website. I would like to thank Horea Porutiu for the excellent teaching, which was not intended for beginners. I documented the entire procedure with the hope that it would prove useful.
