Hello, I’m a Full-Time Professional Fitness Trainer, but my love of technology inspired me to create this website. This is a project I’ve wanted to do for a long time, but I’ve never found the time. I still enjoy fitness, but I’ve begun studying for tech certifications in order to fulfill my dream of becoming a software developer. Thank you for visiting; please find my contact information below:
